## Game Idea
Using a multitude of different flick switches, the player will complete a few minigames, such as controlling the the loading bay and thrusters on a spaceship or doing a series of eliminations to work out a multiple part lock.

In the spaceship minigame, the players switches will control various parts of the ship that would have to be operated manually, such as how much power is going to the thrusters, opening and closing the cargo bay door to catch debris, and more. The player will be informed of the objective and controls at the beginning. Once the player has completed the objective they will be shown a visual cue and eventually returned to the main menu.

For the lock game, the player will have to press a certain randomly generated code that has been generated at the start up of the game. To prevent the player just flicking all the switches at once, the game will lock them out if it's detects all switches active at once. Once the player has managed to complete the objectiveobjective, a visual cue will appear on the screen and after a short time will return them to the menu. 
The main menu will be controlled by the switches, with icons corresponding to the games underneath certain switches.
### Core Mechanics

Switches:

The switches will be a main feature of all the minigames shipped with the product, as they will be required to use for actions in the games instead of being able to use the mouse and keyboard or controller.
