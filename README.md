## Game Idea by Robert Rayner
Using a multitude of different flick switches, the player will complete a few minigames, such as controlling the the loading bay and thrusters on a spaceship or doing a series of eliminations to work out a multiple part lock.
### Core Mechanics

_Flame Sensor_
The flame sensor will be used to determine how far the fire is from the current object, which in turn will define its position on the screen. The closer the flame is to the object, the faster the object will ignite.

_Lighting things on Fire_
Each object will have a randomised resistance to the flame. This will help create a sense of challenge, as some objects will have a low resistance yet only need to be singed a little around the edges.
