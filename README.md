## Game Idea by Robert Rayner
Using a multitude of different flick switches, the player will complete a few minigames, such as controlling the the loading bay and thrusters on a spaceship or doing a series of eliminations to work out a multiple part lock.

In the spaceship minigame, the players switches will control various parts of the ship that would have to be operated manually, such as how much power is going to the thrusters, opening and closing the cargo bay door to catch debris, and more.


### Core Mechanics

Switches: <break>
The switches will be a main feature of all the minigames shipped with the product, as they will be required to use for actions in the games instead of being able to use the mouse and keyboard or controller.
